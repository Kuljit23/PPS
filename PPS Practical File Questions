19.	A library charges per day fine for every book returned late. For first 5 days the fine is 50 paise per day, for 6-10 days fine is one rupee per day and above 10 days and till 30 days fine is 5 rupees per day. If you return the book after 30 days your membership will be cancelled. Write a program to accept the number of days the member is late to return the book and display the fine or appropriate message.
Hint : late_days = 4	fine = Rs 2
late_days = 7	fine = Rs 4.50
late_days = 12	fine = Rs 17.50
